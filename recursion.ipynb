    "The Tower of Hanoi is a well-known computer science and mathematics challenge. It consists of three rods and a variety of disks of varying sizes that may be slotted onto any rod. The problem begins with the disks neatly stacked in ascending order of size on one rod, with the smallest on top. The goal is to shift the full stack to another rod while adhering to the following simple rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "At any given moment, only one disk can be transferred.\n",
    "Each step involves taking the top disk from one of the stacks and putting it on top of another stack or on an empty rod.\n",

    "Recursion in the Tower of Hanoi algorithm works by breaking down the problem into smaller, simpler subproblems and solving them in a recursive manner until reaching the base case, which is the situation with only one disk.
